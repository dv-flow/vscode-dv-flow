Installing
==========

The extension can be installed from the `VSCode Marketplace <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=matthew-ballance.vscode-dv-flow>`_.

Configuring
===========

The DV Flow extension uses `DV Flow Manager <https://dv-flow.github.io/dv-flow-mgr>`_ 
to obtain much of the data that is displayed. The VSCode extension must be have access
to a Python interpreter with access to the DV Flow Manager package.

The DV Flow extension searches for the appropriate interpreter as follows:

* Checks the `python.defaultInterpreterPath` setting in the workspace settings
* Checks for the existence of an `IVPM <https://fvutils.github.io/ivpm>`_ packages directory
* Checks the PATH for the `python3` executable

Features
========

Workspace View
--------------

The DV Flow extension contributes a workspace outline view. This 
view shows information about the tasks defined in the workspace
package.

This view is always active.

The view can be manually-refreshed via `refresh` button.

Single-clicking (selecting) an entry in the `tasks` collection will
open an editor on the task's declaration.


Static Graph View
-----------------

A graphical representation of as task's execution graph can be opened
from the `task` entries in the workspace view.
